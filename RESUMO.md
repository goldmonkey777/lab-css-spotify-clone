# Lesson Summary: Spotify Clone

Built a simple web page using HTML and CSS, following the Spotify homepage example. Main sections include: header with menu, main banner, feature cards, and a "how it works" area. Used provided images and basic styles to make the layout similar to the exercise example.

Learned how to organize HTML into semantic sections, use CSS for styling and layout, separate content from presentation, work with images/icons, and follow practical instructions to turn a visual model into code.

This lesson helped me understand the basics of HTML and CSS, which are essential for any beginner web developer.
